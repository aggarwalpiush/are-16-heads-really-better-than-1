# Are Sixteen Heads Really Better than One?

This repository contains code to reproduce the experiments in our paper [Are Sixteen Heads Really Better than One?](TODO).

## Prerequisite

First, you will need python >=3.6 with `pytorch>=1.0`. Then, clone our forks of `fairseq` (for MT experiments) and `pytorch-pretrained-BERT` (for BERT):

```bash
# Fairseq
git clone https://github.com/pmichel31415/fairseq
# Pytorch pretrained BERT
git clone https://github.com/pmichel31415/pytorch-pretrained-BERT
git checkout paul
```
